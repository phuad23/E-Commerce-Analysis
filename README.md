# E-Commerce-Analysis
Analysis of E-Commerce Sales Dataset
In this Project, i analyzed an e-commerce sales dataset from a global software retailer that sells subscriptions and add-ons across analytics, design, collaboration, and AI. 

I leveraged my DAX skills to create measures and generate insightful visualizations. To finish off, I brought it all together in a sophisticated business dashboard to communicate insights to the Stakeholder.

**Project Steps**
1. Know the Objective
2. Understand the dataset
3. Data Cleaning
4. Data Modeling
5. Data Analysis
6. Data Visualization

Lets dive in!

**Step 1: Know the Objective**

*Business Objective*:
The objective is to identify loyal customers (repeat buyers) and determine which channels and promotional campaigns drive their repeat purchases.

**Step 2: Understand the dataset**

The Dataset is a Global E-Commerce Transaction covering multiple products, plans, and customer segments. This Dataset was provided by Onyx Data.
The dataset has 3 Tables namely:-  Events, Products and Customers. Also the Data dictionary to the dataset was provided for easy understanding of the data.
After carefully going through the data, i loaded the data into the PowerBi desktop app for data cleaning.

**Step 3: Data Cleaning**

Data Cleaning is one of the most important process in data analysis. if you do not clean your data properly, your analysis wont be accurate and it will affect the insight you will generate.
i went through the ETL process which is, i extracted my data first then transform it before loading the data. The transformation of the data which also means cleaning of the data was done using power query.
The data is not that messy so i checked for the duplicate value, missing value and the data types of the column name to see if it really correspond with the column name.

**Step 4: Data Modelling**

The data model was done joined the Facts table  which is the (Events Table) to the Dimension Tables which are (Products and Customers Table) based on their relationship.
below is the data model of this project
